A fast, asynchronous Discord bot designed to monitor internal bank payment APIs, report transaction volumes, and track API health statuses in real-time. Built with a focus on reliability and DevOps practices.

## ✨ Features

- **🚀 Asynchronous Engine:** Utilizes `aiohttp` for non-blocking API requests, ensuring the bot remains responsive even during high-latency network events.
- **📊 Interactive Dashboard:** A persistent Discord UI (Buttons & Modals) allowing authorized users to query transaction data for Today, Yesterday, or any Custom Date.
- **⏰ Automated Reporting:** Built-in scheduled tasks (`discord.ext.tasks`) to automatically fetch and broadcast daily summaries at 07:30 AM.
- **🛡️ Secure Configuration:** Environment variable (`.env`) management to protect sensitive Bot Tokens and API endpoints.
- **🧹 Auto-Cleanup:** Smart channel management that purges old report messages to keep the monitoring channel clean and readable.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Core:** Python 3.12
- **Libraries:** `discord.py`, `aiohttp`, `python-dotenv`
- **Architecture:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with distinct layers (Config, Engine, UI, Main).
